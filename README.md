- Proposed device is for detecting a change in heart-rate, body temperature and jerky or twitchy movements in the body during convulsions. 
- Once the movements are detected, based on the severity of the movements, a notification is sent to the emergency contact, seeking for help.
- We will be using Arduino, heart-beat sensor, temperature sensor, IoT.
